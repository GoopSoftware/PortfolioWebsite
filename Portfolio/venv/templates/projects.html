The game features a game speed mechanic that increases or decreases according to player ability. The game was built using an object-oriented design structure.",

The project focuses on creating a fireworks explosion capturing the motion interaction and explosion effects in real-life fireworks. The system uses physics based calculations to handle the trajectory, burst pattern, and gravity of each explosion and particle.",

         "This project was an introduction to Axis Aligned Bounding Boxes and a collision system that attempts to prevent interpenetration. Built with OOP principles in C++, this system manages collision data dynamically and effectively. Its design makes it easy to integrate into various 2D projects allowing mechanics such as crate pushing and platform creation. The movement feels natural to the player allowing gameplay to feel fluid. It is a key component to my future collision development.",
