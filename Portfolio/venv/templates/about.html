  <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Video games were a part of my life growing up. I still remember the excitement of getting home from school and diving into my favorite games, sometimes even staying up past my bedtime just to keep playing. Those early experiences ignited my passion for gaming and inspired me to go all in on creating them.

Specializing in C++ game engine development, I focus on building the systems that power innovative and engaging gameplay. My journey in game development is driven by a lifelong love of video games and a desire to craft experiences that capture the same magic I felt as a kid.</p>
